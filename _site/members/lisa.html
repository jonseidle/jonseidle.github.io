<meta name="description" content="Meet Lisa! She&#39;s been singing with Halcyon for 11 years now and is an emergency physician with the health region. She has too many favourites to pick just one piece of music, but she loves Esto Les Digo by Lange, O Magnum Mysterium by Lauridsen and any Eric Whitacre pieces or Broadway shows. Her favourite Halcyon moments are from when we start getting creative with choreography and presentation or do something unexpected with the music. Highlights include scarves and spinning while singing Jenkins, risking life and limb climbing over the balconies, the Flying V tango, and the last-minute choreography with the symphony, including fake slapping the guest artist in the face. Every time you wonder how it’s going to turn out, and it always ends up awesome!" />
