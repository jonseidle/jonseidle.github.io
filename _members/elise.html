<p>Meet Elise! She's been singing with Halcyon for 5 years now and is a registered nurse at the Pasqua Hospital.</p>
<p>Her favourite piece is anything Broadway or, of course, our beloved Messiah. Her favourite memory is when the whole choir nailed the “kick your knees up” choreography in Step in Time at our Broadway concert, and all of our delicious Christmas dinners!</p>
