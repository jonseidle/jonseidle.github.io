<meta name="description" content="Meet Andrew! He has been around practically since Halcyon’s inception at 14 years! He works in the IT department for SaskPower and his favourite piece is O Salutaris Hostia by Eriks Esenvalds. His favourite moment was best described by the man himself... &quot;Singing Fogarty’s Cove with all of the men in the choir. We ran onto the stage and had a full ship set up within about 6 seconds. It was complete with a crow’s nest and sail. Everyone was dressed up in their best nautical wear with lots of lifejackets, rubber boots and raincoats. One of the guys was volunteered to play the role of the girl in the song, and he wore an absolutely hideous wig. The audience loved it, and we had an incredible amount of fun.&quot;" />
