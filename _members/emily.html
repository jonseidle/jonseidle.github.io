<p>Meet Emily! She initially joined Halcyon in 2009 and has been a member most of that time when not either in school for or actively working as a nurse at the Pasqua Hospital. Her favourite piece of music is When David Heard by one of the choirâ€™s favourite choral composers, Eric Whitacre.</p>
<p>Her favourite memory of being in the choir was watching the incredibly talented tenor soloist the first time we sang Carmina Burana with the Regina Symphony Orchestra!</p>
