<p>Meet Jen! Jen just joined Halcyon this past September and is in Fine Arts at University of Regina. She works a variety of part time jobs at Yoga Mala, Hillberg and Berk, and also instructs ballet classes!</p>
<p>Her favourite choral piece is Stars, a piece Halcyon performed at our last concert which she really enjoyed. Though as much as she loves performing, her favourite moments in the choir are usually chatting with the other choristers and snacking during break!</p>
