<p>Meet Holly! Having been in Halcyon since grade 6, sheâ€™s now a first-year business student at the U of R. She loves all music by Karl Jenkins, Eric Whitacre and the musical Wicked!</p>
<p>Her favourite memory of being in the choir was when we arrived at rehearsal to find the power was out. Undeterred, we started working by candlelight!</p>
