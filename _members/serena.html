<p>Meet Serena! Joining us back in 2008, Serena was just finishing up her high school career. Now a teacher in Regina's Catholic Schools, she continues to love singing with Halcyon and the variety of repertoire that we sing.</p>
<p>One of her favourite pieces of music is O Magnum Mysterium by Morten Lauridsen. Serena has fond memories of her first concert with Halcyon singing Carmina Buranaby Carl Orff.</p>
