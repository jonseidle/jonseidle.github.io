<p>Meet Robyn! This is her second year singing with Halcyon. She is a Regina-based theatre artist, having graduated from both the Globe Theatre Conservatory and the University of Regina. When not pursuing theatre, she works with the Regina Public Library. </p>
<p>Her favourite piece (thus far) is Karl Jenkins's <em>Stabat Mater</em>, which we sang at our last concert, and her favourite memory was from last season where we sang <em>A Night of Brahms</em> with the Regina Symphony Orchestra on stage at the Conexus Arts Centre!</p>
