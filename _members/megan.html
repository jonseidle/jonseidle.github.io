<p>Meet Megan! This is her second year singing with Halcyon and loving it! As a doctor at the Family Medicine Unit here in Regina, she found it hard to choose what her favourite piece of music is, but like a few others, her favourite experience with the choir was singing by candlelight when the power went out.</p>
<p>"I was disappointed when the power came back onâ€¦"</p>
