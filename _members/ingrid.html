<p>Meet Ingrid! She started singing with Halcyon back when she was in grade 9. Now, 5 years later, she is a first-year Nursing student at the University of Regina and loves everything and anything Broadway!</p>
<p>As such, one of her favourite memories was the whole broadway concert from 2016 but in particular loved the choreography for Step in Time as well as Jolly Holiday.</p>
