<p>Meet Andrea! She’s been a soprano with the choir since 2005 and works as a professional photographer here in Regina.</p>
<p>Her favourite choral work is Carmina Burana and her favourite Halcyon memory is from the first time the choir performed “The Armed Man” by Karl Jenkins. During the movement “Save Me From Bloody Men” which is 98% sung, just before the ending there is a sudden (and surprising) bass drum hit that startled one audience member so badly she screamed.</p>
