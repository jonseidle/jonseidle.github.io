<p>Meet Carol! While she technically has only been an (official) member of Halcyon for the past 3 or 4 years, she's been attending our rehearsals for longer and is the mother of two current and two former members: Bella, Jaire, Mireya, and Chuck!</p>
<p>In her day to day, she is a teacher and has taught most subjects (and a good portion of the choir too!) at some point. She loves anything Baroque and Broadway, and loves that the choir is something she's been able to share with her kids, and always enjoys our occasional shared concert with Per Sonatori.</p>
