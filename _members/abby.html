<p>Meet Abby! This is her first year with the choir. She's 14 and is in Grade 9 at Riffel.</p>
<p>Her favourite choral piece is Stars by Eriks Esenvalds and her favourite Halcyon moment so far was after our recent "Lost in Darkness" concert because it was her first concert and she made it through!</p>
