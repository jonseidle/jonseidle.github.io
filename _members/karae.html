<p>Meet Karae! She’s been with Halcyon Chamber Choir since the Fall of 2012. She is a Kindergarten teacher with Regina Public schools (singing with students by day, adults by night!). She adores everything Eric Whitacre and is also a lover of Musical Theatre.</p>
<p>Her favourite memory of being in the choir is the many Broadway concerts we’ve done over the years (it was too hard to pick just one!) and, of course, singing the Messiah every year!</p>
