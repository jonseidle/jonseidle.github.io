<p>Meet Candice! She’s been a part of the Halcyon family since the fall of 2012. She’s a graduate of the University of Regina with a Bachelor of Music in Performance and currently works at APEGS as an Administrative Assistant.</p>
<p>Her favourite music is more of a category (“anything Musical Theatre!”) and her favourite memory is singing by candlelight the night the power went out during rehearsal!</p>
