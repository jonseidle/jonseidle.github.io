While she technically has only been an (official) member of Halcyon for the past 3 or 4 years, she&#39;s been attending our rehearsals for longer and is the mother of two current and two former members: Bella, Jaire, Mireya, and Chuck! In her day to day, she is a teacher and has taught most subjects (and a good portion of the choir too!) at some point.
