He’s currently in the process of completing his requirements for a BMus in Voice Performance at University of Regina and he also works in the Regina area as a collaborative pianist and vocal coach. His favourite piece is a toss up between Eric Whitacre’s haunting When David Heard and Rajaton’s Dobbin’s Flowery Vale. In terms of his favourite Halcyon memory, he says it best in his own words... &quot;I’ve had many great memories singing with Halcyon, but I particularly enjoyed the times that Halcyon performed as the live choir for the Regina performances of Video Games Live. It was just such a neat experience and it was amazing getting the chance to sing for such an enthusiastic audience who might not normally come to a choir/orchestra concert.&quot;" />
