<p>Meet Colton! He originally joined in 2011 while in his 2nd year of university. 6 years later, he’s now employed with the Government of Saskatchewan in the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>While he has trouble picking a single favourite piece of music, he’s quite fond of Leonardo Dreams of His Flying Machine by Eric Whitacre, which Halcyon has performed on one or two occasions. His favourite Halcyon moments are a toss-up between performing Disney music and Handel’s Messiah!</p>
